AI-Enhanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS)Project DescriptionThis project presents an AI-Enhanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to detect and classify malicious network traffic using machine learning techniques.  The system is based on a Neural Network model trained on the CICIDS2017 dataset, enabling it to distinguish between normal and malicious network flows with very high accuracy.Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems rely on static rules and signatures, which limits their ability to detect new or evolving attacks. This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence can significantly enhance network security by learning traffic behavior and detecting attacks automatically.---ObjectivesUnderstand the fundamentals of cybersecurity and intrusion detectionApply machine learning techniques to network securityPreprocess real network traffic dataTrain and evaluate a neural network classifierSimulate real-time intrusion detectionVisualize detection results using a dashboard---DatasetName: CICIDS2017Source: Canadian Institute for CybersecurityDescription:  The dataset contains realistic network traffic including normal activity and multiple types of cyberattacks such as DoS, DDoS, and brute-force attacks. Each record represents a network flow described by statistical features.---Technologies UsedProgramming LanguagePython 3.10Libraries & ToolsNumPyPandasScikit-learnTensorFlow / KerasJoblibStreamlit---Project StructureAI_IDS/│├── data/│ ├── CICIDS2017.csv│ └── processed_data.pkl│├── preprocessing.py├── train_model.py├── evaluate_model.py├── realtime_detection.py├── dashboard.py├── model.h5├── AI_Enhanced_IDS_Report.pdf└── README.md---File Descriptionpreprocessing.py  Cleans and preprocesses the dataset (handling missing values, normalization, label encoding).train_model.py  Trains a neural network model using the processed data and saves the trained model.evaluate_model.py  Evaluates the trained model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.realtime_detection.py  Simulates real-time intrusion detection using generated network traffic features.dashboard.py  Streamlit-based dashboard that displays real-time detection alerts.model.h5  Saved trained neural network model.AI_Enhanced_IDS_Report.tex  Full academic report written in LaTeX.---How to Run the Project1.
